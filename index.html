    <div class="divider"></div>
    
    <p>

    Miamiblatdr.com is a local Miami boat service and repair shop. They offer outboard repair, parts and trailers for boats. Their website demonstrates what their shop offers to the general public, which is mainly marine equipment and parts. A strong part of their background relies on transmission rebuilding and engine overhauls. Since this is a giant market in Miami, the competition is large and their website plays a big role in gettin clients from all over Florida, targeting the local South Florida market.
